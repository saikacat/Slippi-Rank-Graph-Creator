# Slippi-Rank-Graph-Creator

## What is this?

Threw together quick code to monitor slippi leaderboards from http://slprank.com/. Tracks the ranks and creates a chart when it updates.
I used repl.it to host this for free.

## How do I run it?

Need these dependencies \n
python = ">=3.8.0,<3.9" \n
numpy = "^1.22.2" \n
replit = "^3.2.4" \n
Flask = "^2.2.0" \n
urllib3 = "^1.26.12" \n 
pandas = "^1.5.2"  \n
matplotlib = "^3.6.2" \n

Run Main.py. The program should automatically create JSON files of the current players. Graphs look something like this YAP
