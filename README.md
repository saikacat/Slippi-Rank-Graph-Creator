# Slippi-Rank-Graph-Creator

## What is this?

Threw together quick code to monitor slippi leaderboards from http://slprank.com/. Tracks the ranks and creates a chart when it updates, I used repl.it to host this for free.

## How do I run it?

From looking at pyproject, we probably need these dependencies python = ">=3.8.0,<3.9" numpy = "^1.22.2" replit = "^3.2.4" Flask = "^2.2.0" urllib3 = "^1.26.12" pandas = "^1.5.2" matplotlib = "^3.6.2"

Run Main.py. The program should automatically create JSON files of the current players. Graphs look something like this YAP
